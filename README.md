# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts for predicting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons).

## Overview:
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective management of the disease. In this project, we explore different machine learning models to predict Parkinson's disease based on various features.

## Features:
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and characteristics.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing correlated attributes, and feature scaling are performed to prepare the data for modeling.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Several machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers are trained and evaluated on the dataset.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy metrics, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

## Repository Structure:
- **`parkinsons_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Text file listing all the dependencies required to run the code.

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started:
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
