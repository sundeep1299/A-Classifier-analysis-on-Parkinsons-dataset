#Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains Python scripts for predicting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is parkinsons.data, which contains various acoustic features extracted from the speech signals of Parkinson's disease patients. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Machine Learning Models
We have implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models for predicting Parkinson's disease:

Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using various performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
